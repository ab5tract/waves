    # A NotFoundError means what you think it means.  The dispatchers included with Waves do not
    # natively intercept this exception.  Instead an exception handler must be registered in the application
    # mappings.  The Simple foundation registers a minimal handler, while the Default foundation registers
    # a slightly fleshier one.

    # response status and location.

    # Waves::Dispatchers::Base provides the basic request processing structure for a Rack application.
    # It creates a Waves request, determines whether to enclose the request processing in a mutex
    # benchmarks it, logs it, and handles redirects. Derived classes need only 
    # process the request within the +safe+ method, which must take a Waves::Request and return a Waves::Response.
